# Getting Started Guide for Developers

The Audi Design System contains a collection of React components that can be used to build accessible and performant
React applications consistent with Audi brand guidelines. This getting started guide provides the basic instructions
to install the Audi Design System components as a dependency in your application and begin using those components.
The documentation for each individual component provides more detailed information including:

- An overview with contextual usage guidance and best practices
- Examples of common variations of the component such as sizes and states
- Guidance for using the components with accessiblity in mind
- A detailed description of available React props along with an interactive playground environment

## Using this project

The Audi Design System is typically installed into a project managed by npm or yarn as a JavaScript package from the Audi GitHub Package Registry.

Add the Audi scoped package registry to your list of available registries through a .npmrc file located at the root of your project:

```
always-auth=true
@audi:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Note: Since the repository is currently private, remember to authenticate for GitHub following this guide. To sign up for an access token,
please contact DesignOps and provide the following information:

- Email
- Name
- Agency/employer
- Github username (optional)

Now add this project as a dependency of your project with:

```
npm install --save @audi/audi-ui-react
```

or if you are using Yarn:

```
yarn add @audi/audi-ui-react
```

### The <AudiPlatformProvider> component

To use components from Audi UI React, you need to wrap your app with a <AudiPlatformProvider> component.

```
import { AudiPlatformProvider } from '@audi/audi-ui-react'
import * as React from 'react'
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

ReactDOM.render(
  <AudiPlatformProvider>
    <App />
  </AudiPlatformProvider>,
  container
)
```

The <AudiPlatformProvider> component does a few things:

- @font-family definitions for AudiType fonts are established
- The Audi theme is provided to styled-components descendents of <AudiPlatformProvider> regardless of how deep.

### Using components

The following is a basic example of the use of the Button component. Please see individual component documentation pages for detailed usage instructions.

```
import { Button } from '@audi/audi-ui-react'

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Button variant="primary" size="small">
    Hello there!
  </Button>
)
```

## Advanced

### Overcoming issues with specificity

In some cases Audi UI components will be integrated into systems with existing CSS. In these cases it is possible that existing CSS rules may have higher
specificity than Audi UI components, resulting in unexpected styles. In order to overcome style specificity issues it is possible to use the StyleSheetManager from
styled-components in conjunction with a stylis plugin that adds extra scope to each CSS rule, such as stylis-plugin-extra-scope.

```
import { StyleSheetManager } from 'styled-components'
import extraScopePlugin from 'stylis-plugin-extra-scope'

const MyApp = () => (
  <StyleSheetManager stylisPlugins={[extraScopePlugin('#myapp')]}>
    <AudiPlatformProvider>...</AudiPlatformProvider>
  </StyleSheetManager>
)
```

#### Using (private) packages from different GitHub organizations

In some project settings it may be required to use packages from more than one GitHub organization. The method for authentication mentioned above works only
if you don't have to install any other packages from the GitHub Package Registry that require authentication. In order to authenticate to multiple namespaces you have to
adjust your projects .npmrc:

```
always-auth=true

@foo:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
@audi:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/audi/
```

And in your global ~/.npmrc file adjust the path accordingly as well and replace AUDI_ORGANIZATION_TOKEN by the token you received from DesignOps:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<USER_TOKEN>
//npm.pkg.github.com/audi/:_authToken=<AUDI_ORGANIZATION_TOKEN>
```

Note: This kind of authentication does not work with yarn. At the moment GitHub officially supports only npm.

### Peer Dependencies

If your application has a dependency on React or Styled Components, Audi Design System will use those instances.

However, versions of Styled Components starting with 5.2.0 are not compatible with the Audi Design System due to breaking
changes that were introduced in that version.

Styled Components 5.2.0 is not backward compatible with 5.1.1. This minor version increase does not adhere to semver semantics,
and should be viewed as a major version release of Styled Components.

If your project currently requires styled-components ^5.2.0 and you wish to use the Audi Design System, you must change your
application to depend on a version of styled-components that matches ~5.1.0 or remove your project's dependency on styled-components.
When selecting version 5.1.1, it is recommended that you pay special attention to styled components that make use of nested & selectors
to ensure that no regressions are introduced.

### Configuring Babel

We ship two types of module formats: CommonJS and ESModules. Most modern build tools will use the latter resolved from the package.json
module entry. To keep our module code as clean as possible, we try to use the latest possible ECMAScript version as target for our
transpilation. So if you have to support browsers that don't support certain modern ECMAScript features, you may want to configure your build
tools accordingly. Here's an example for babel:

```

// babel.config.js
const path = require('path');
module.exports {
  include: [
    ...,
    path.resolve('node_modules/@audi/audi-ui-react'),
  ],
  ...
}
```
