# Getting Started Guide for Designers

The Audi Design System is used to communicate Audi's brand identity and user interface components.
Audi user interfaces are as varied as their uses, ranging from inspiring websites to applications for
a particular service. The aim is to create solutions that provide a well-balanced, system-wide user
experience that seamlessly transitions from the app to the vehicle using a core set of components,
modules, and animations. The Audi Design Kit acts as the foundation, containing the core components
that can be applied to all user interface designs created for Audi's digital suite of products. The
Getting Started Guide outlined on this page provides instructions on how to install the Audi Design
Kit and implement it within your project.

## Installation

Components that are in active development.

To install the relevant fonts and applications necessary to access, view, and use the Audi Design Kit:

1. Install the Audi Type Font

Download the latest Audi Type font from the Typography page. Scroll to the "Assets" section and click the
link under the "Steps to use font" section.

2. Install Sketch

Sketch is the chosen design platform for Audi. To access the Audi Design Kit, work within existing design files,
or create new designs from scratch, designers and developers must install and use the latest version of Sketch.

3. Download Library - Audi Design Kit

Libraries are Sketch documents with core components that can be shared across all teams and products. When updates
are made to components in a Library, other Sketch projects with that Library linked will be notified that changes have
been made. To ensure designers are using the most up-to-date components in their products, the Audi Design Kit was created as a Library.

Download the Audi Design Kit to get the latest Audi Sketch Library. Updates will be made to the Audi Design Kit on a regular
basis. The Design Operations team will communicate when new versions of the Library are available for download.

4. Add Library - Audi Design Kit - in Sketch

With the Audi Design Kit downloaded, designers must then add this Library to their new or existing Sketch projects. To do this,
open Sketch’s Preferences by choosing Sketch > Preferences. From there, either drag the Audi Design Kit into the window, or use the
"Add Library…" button to browse for the correct file.

5. Start Designing

With the Audi Design Kit added to Sketch, begin designing! Enjoy.
