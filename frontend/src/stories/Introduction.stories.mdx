# Introduction to the Patton Univercity Design & Development Systems

The Patton UniverCity design and developement system was created to help us build components and documentation for designers and developers to work more efficiently.
Establishing a single source of truth for design and developement working on Pattton UniverCity products across the organization. The docs contains everything from
Getting Started guides through to Core Components intended for adoption within each product. It enables product teams to design and develop with speed, consistency,
and quality.

## Vision

Patton UniverCity is a catalyst for students and ongoing learns to improve their skills sets and gain confidence to achieve more. We focus on building technology that
vastly improves the current learning standards. Education is often a field that is given traditional means of learning with few improvements.

## Objectives & Benefits

<p></p>

### Consistency

Create a common set of principles, resources, and components to improve consistency and end user experience across Patton UniverCity products.

#### Benefits

- Creates a single source of truth for product teams
- Improves quality as a result of documented and applied standards
- Improves user experience as a result of consistent components, design interactions, and patterns

### Efficiency

Develop a unified system, with the appropriate governance applied, to increase the speed at which product teams produce new or improved components, and reduce duplication.

#### Benefits

- Harnesses the collective power of multiple product teams to deliver more effectively
- Reduces duplication of work across Patton UniverCity markets and product teams
- Frees up time to focus on innovation through new technology and frameworks

### Collaboration

Create an open, extensive, and evolving platform accessible for all stakeholders to support collaboration between disciplines, teams, and markets.

#### Benefits

- Improves collaboration between disciplines through common tools and language
- Creates the foundation for scale, with other product teams and markets
- Improves the onboarding experience for product team members
